      CHAPTER V. THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS
    </h2>
<p>
      186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle,
      belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the "Science of Morals"
      belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:—an
      interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the
      very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, "Science of Morals" is,
      in respect to what is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter
      to GOOD taste,—which is always a foretaste of more modest
      expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT is still
      necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the present:
      namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey and
      classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth, and
      distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish—and
      perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common
      forms of these living crystallizations—as preparation for a THEORY
      OF TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.
      All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, demanded
      of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and
      ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:
      they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality—and every philosopher
      hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself,
      however, has been regarded as something "given." How far from their
      awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem—left in dust
      and decay—of a description of forms of morality, notwithstanding
      that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It
      was precisely owing to moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts
      imperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement—perhaps
      as the morality of their environment, their position, their church, their
      Zeitgeist, their climate and zone—it was precisely because they were
      badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by
      no means eager to know about these matters, that they did not even come in
      sight of the real problems of morals—problems which only disclose
      themselves by a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every "Science of
      Morals" hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself
      has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything
      problematic there! That which philosophers called "giving a basis to
      morality," and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light,
      proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new
      means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the
      sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of
      denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question—and
      in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and
      vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what innocence—almost
      worthy of honour—Schopenhauer represents his own task, and draw your
      conclusions concerning the scientificness of a "Science" whose latest
      master still talks in the strain of children and old wives: "The
      principle," he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der Ethik), [Footnote:
      Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality, translated by Arthur B.
      Bullock, M.A. (1903).] "the axiom about the purport of which all moralists
      are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva—is
      REALLY the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish, ...
      the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like the philosopher's
      stone, for centuries."—The difficulty of establishing the
      proposition referred to may indeed be great—it is well known that
      Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts; and whoever has
      thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition
      is, in a world whose essence is Will to Power, may be reminded that
      Schopenhauer, although a pessimist, ACTUALLY—played the flute...
      daily after dinner: one may read about the matter in his biography. A
      question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world,
      who MAKES A HALT at morality—who assents to morality, and plays the
      flute to laede-neminem morals, what? Is that really—a pessimist?
    </p>
<p>
      187. Apart from the value of such assertions as "there is a categorical
      imperative in us," one can always ask: What does such an assertion
      indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are
      meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems
      of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied; with
      other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others he
      wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others to
      glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,—this system of
      morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something of
      him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative
      arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant especially, gives
      us to understand by his morals that "what is estimable in me, is that I
      know how to obey—and with you it SHALL not be otherwise than with
      me!" In short, systems of morals are only a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.
    </p>
<p>
      188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of
      tyranny against "nature" and also against "reason", that is, however, no
      objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that
      all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is essential
      and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long constraint.
      In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should
      remember the constraint under which every language has attained to
      strength and freedom—the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme
      and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation
      given themselves!—not excepting some of the prose writers of today,
      in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness—"for the sake of
      a folly," as utilitarian bunglers say, and thereby deem themselves wise—"from
      submission to arbitrary laws," as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy
      themselves "free," even free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however,
      that everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and
      masterly certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought
      itself, or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just
      as in conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such
      arbitrary law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that
      precisely this is "nature" and "natural"—and not laisser-aller!
      Every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is
      his "most natural" condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing, and
      constructing in the moments of "inspiration"—and how strictly and
      delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness
      and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most
      stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold,
      and ambiguous in it). The essential thing "in heaven and in earth" is,
      apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE
      in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in
      the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance,
      virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality—anything whatever
      that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of
      the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas,
      the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance
      with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian
      premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that
      happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every occurrence to
      rediscover and justify the Christian God:—all this violence,
      arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved
      itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has attained its
      strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that
      much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and
      spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, "nature" shows herself as
      she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT magnificence, which is
      shocking, but nevertheless noble). That for centuries European thinkers
      only thought in order to prove something—nowadays, on the contrary,
      we are suspicious of every thinker who "wishes to prove something"—that
      it was always settled beforehand what WAS TO BE the result of their
      strictest thinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former
      times, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent,
      Christian-moral explanation of immediate personal events "for the glory of
      God," or "for the good of the soul":—this tyranny, this
      arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit;
      slavery, both in the coarser and the finer sense, is apparently an
      indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline. One may
      look at every system of morals in this light: it is "nature" therein which
      teaches to hate the laisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the
      need for limited horizons, for immediate duties—it teaches the
      NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is
      a condition of life and development. "Thou must obey some one, and for a
      long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for
      thyself"—this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature,
      which is certainly neither "categorical," as old Kant wished (consequently
      the "otherwise"), nor does it address itself to the individual (what does
      nature care for the individual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks;
      above all, however, to the animal "man" generally, to MANKIND.
    </p>
<p>
      189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a
      master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such an
      extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week—and
      work-day again:—as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated
      FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although, as
      is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect to work).
      Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and
      habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are
      appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to hunger anew.
      Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and epochs, when they
      show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism, seem like those
      intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during which an impulse
      learns to humble and submit itself—at the same time also to PURIFY
      and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a
      similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic
      culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with Aphrodisiacal
      odours).—Here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox, why
      it was precisely in the most Christian period of European history, and in
      general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments, that the sexual
      impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).
    </p>
<p>
      190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really
      belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might say,
      in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was too noble.
      "No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly. The
      evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do so, however, if he
      knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is only evil through
      error; if one free him from error one will necessarily make him—good."—This
      mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the
      unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that "it is
      STUPID to do wrong"; while they accept "good" as identical with "useful
      and pleasant," without further thought. As regards every system of
      utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and
      follow the scent: one will seldom err.—Plato did all he could to
      interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and
      above all to interpret himself into them—he, the most daring of all
      interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a
      popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible
      modifications—namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities.
      In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the Platonic Socrates,
      if not—[Greek words inserted here.]
    </p>
<p>
      191. The old theological problem of "Faith" and "Knowledge," or more
      plainly, of instinct and reason—the question whether, in respect to
      the valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than
      rationality, which wants to appreciate and act according to motives,
      according to a "Why," that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility—it
      is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of
      Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates
      himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent—that of a
      surpassing dialectician—took first the side of reason; and, in fact,
      what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the
      noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could
      never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?
      In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also at
      himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself
      the same difficulty and incapacity. "But why"—he said to himself—"should
      one on that account separate oneself from the instincts! One must set them
      right, and the reason ALSO—one must follow the instincts, but at the
      same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments." This
      was the real FALSENESS of that great and mysterious ironist; he brought
      his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of
      self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral
      judgment.—Plato, more innocent in such matters, and without the
      craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure
      of all his strength—the greatest strength a philosopher had ever
      expended—that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal, to
      the good, to "God"; and since Plato, all theologians and philosophers have
      followed the same path—which means that in matters of morality,
      instinct (or as Christians call it, "Faith," or as I call it, "the herd")
      has hitherto triumphed. Unless one should make an exception in the case of
      Descartes, the father of rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of
      the Revolution), who recognized only the authority of reason: but reason
      is only a tool, and Descartes was superficial.
    </p>
<p>
      192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in its
      development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest
      processes of all "knowledge and cognizance": there, as here, the premature
      hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to "belief," and the lack
      of distrust and patience are first developed—our senses learn late,
      and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of
      knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a
      picture already often produced, than to seize upon the divergence and
      novelty of an impression: the latter requires more force, more "morality."
      It is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new; we hear
      strange music badly. When we hear another language spoken, we
      involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are more
      familiar and conversant—it was thus, for example, that the Germans
      modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses
      are also hostile and averse to the new; and generally, even in the
      "simplest" processes of sensation, the emotions DOMINATE—such as
      fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion of indolence.—As little
      as a reader nowadays reads all the single words (not to speak of
      syllables) of a page—he rather takes about five out of every twenty
      words at random, and "guesses" the probably appropriate sense to them—just
      as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its
      leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much easier to fancy
      the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the most remarkable
      experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the greater part of
      the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate any event, EXCEPT as
      "inventors" thereof. All this goes to prove that from our fundamental
      nature and from remote ages we have been—ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to
      express it more politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly—one
      is much more of an artist than one is aware of.—In an animated
      conversation, I often see the face of the person with whom I am speaking
      so clearly and sharply defined before me, according to the thought he
      expresses, or which I believe to be evoked in his mind, that the degree of
      distinctness far exceeds the STRENGTH of my visual faculty—the
      delicacy of the play of the muscles and of the expression of the eyes MUST
      therefore be imagined by me. Probably the person put on quite a different
      expression, or none at all.
    </p>
<p>
      193. Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What we
      experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at last
      just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything "actually"
      experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we have a
      requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and even in the
      brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some extent by the
      nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has often flown in his
      dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the
      power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable
      happiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest impulse, he
      can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who knows the sensation of a
      certain divine levity, an "upwards" without effort or constraint, a
      "downwards" without descending or lowering—without TROUBLE!—how
      could the man with such dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find
      "happiness" differently coloured and defined, even in his waking hours!
      How could he fail—to long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? "Flight," such
      as is described by poets, must, when compared with his own "flying," be
      far too earthly, muscular, violent, far too "troublesome" for him.
    </p>
<p>
      194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the
      difference of their lists of desirable things—in their regarding
      different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to the
      greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized
      desirable things:—it manifests itself much more in what they regard
      as actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman,
      for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification
      serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more
      modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for
      possession, sees the "questionableness," the mere apparentness of such
      ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially
      whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for his
      sake what she has or would like to have—only THEN does he look upon
      her as "possessed." A third, however, has not even here got to the limit
      of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether the
      woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a
      phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well
      known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found
      out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when
      she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much
      for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his
      goodness, patience, and spirituality. One man would like to possess a
      nation, and he finds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina
      suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more refined thirst for
      possession, says to himself: "One may not deceive where one desires to
      possess"—he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of
      him should rule in the hearts of the people: "I must, therefore, MAKE
      myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!" Among helpful and
      charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which
      first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as though, for instance,
      he should "merit" help, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself
      deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. With
      these conceits, they take control of the needy as a property, just as in
      general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property. One
      finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity.
      Parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children—they
      call that "education"; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that
      the child she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates about
      his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times
      fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or
      death of the newly born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the
      father, so also do the teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince
      still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new
      possession. The consequence is...
    </p>
<p>
      195. The Jews—a people "born for slavery," as Tacitus and the whole
      ancient world say of them; "the chosen people among the nations," as they
      themselves say and believe—the Jews performed the miracle of the
      inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new
      and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fused into
      one the expressions "rich," "godless," "wicked," "violent," "sensual," and
      for the first time coined the word "world" as a term of reproach. In this
      inversion of valuations (in which is also included the use of the word
      "poor" as synonymous with "saint" and "friend") the significance of the
      Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that the SLAVE-INSURRECTION
      IN MORALS commences.
    </p>
<p>
      196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near the
      sun—such as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this is an
      allegory; and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing
      merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be
      unexpressed.
    </p>
<p>
      197. The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar Borgia)
      are fundamentally misunderstood, "nature" is misunderstood, so long as one
      seeks a "morbidness" in the constitution of these healthiest of all
      tropical monsters and growths, or even an innate "hell" in them—as
      almost all moralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is a
      hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists? And that
      the "tropical man" must be discredited at all costs, whether as disease
      and deterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and self-torture? And
      why? In favour of the "temperate zones"? In favour of the temperate men?
      The "moral"? The mediocre?—This for the chapter: "Morals as
      Timidity."
    </p>
<p>
      198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to
      their "happiness," as it is called—what else are they but
      suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves
      in which the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and
      bad propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like to
      play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations, permeated
      with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife wisdom; all of
      them grotesque and absurd in their form—because they address
      themselves to "all," because they generalize where generalization is not
      authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally, and taking themselves
      unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt,
      but rather endurable only, and sometimes even seductive, when they are
      over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously, especially of "the other
      world." That is all of little value when estimated intellectually, and is
      far from being "science," much less "wisdom"; but, repeated once more, and
      three times repeated, it is expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with
      stupidity, stupidity, stupidity—whether it be the indifference and
      statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the
      Stoics advised and fostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping
      of Spinoza, the destruction of the emotions by their analysis and
      vivisection, which he recommended so naively; or the lowering of the
      emotions to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied, the
      Aristotelianism of morals; or even morality as the enjoyment of the
      emotions in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism
      of art, perhaps as music, or as love of God, and of mankind for God's sake—for
      in religion the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that...; or,
      finally, even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has
      been taught by Hafis and Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the
      spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise
      old codgers and drunkards, with whom it "no longer has much danger."—This
      also for the chapter: "Morals as Timidity."

      199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have
      also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples,
      states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion to the
      small number who command—in view, therefore, of the fact that
      obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto, one
      may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is now
      innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives the
      command "Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally refrain
      from something", in short, "Thou shalt". This need tries to satisfy itself
      and to fill its form with a content, according to its strength,
      impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite
      with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all
      sorts of commanders—parents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, or
      public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human development, the
      hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof,
      is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is
      transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If one imagine
      this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders and
      independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they will
      suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose a deception
      on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if
      they also were only obeying. This condition of things actually exists in
      Europe at present—I call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding
      class. They know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad
      conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher
      orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of the law, or
      of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims from the
      current opinions of the herd, as "first servants of their people," or
      "instruments of the public weal". On the other hand, the gregarious
      European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man
      that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as public spirit,
      kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy,
      by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the herd, as the
      peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however, where it is believed that the
      leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is
      made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever
      gregarious men all representative constitutions, for example, are of this
      origin. In spite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight
      becoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these
      gregarious Europeans—of this fact the effect of the appearance of
      Napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of Napoleon
      is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century
      has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods.

      200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one
      another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his body—that
      is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts and standards
      of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom at peace—such
      a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an average, be a weak
      man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to
      an end; happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine
      and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is above
      all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of repletion, of
      final unity—it is the "Sabbath of Sabbaths," to use the expression
      of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who was himself such a man.—Should,
      however, the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an
      ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus to life—and if, on the other hand,
      in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also
      inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for
      carrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of
      self-control and self-deception), there then arise those marvelously
      incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men,
      predestined for conquering and circumventing others, the finest examples
      of which are Alcibiades and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate
      the FIRST of Europeans according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick
      the Second), and among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear
      precisely in the same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for
      repose, comes to the front; the two types are complementary to each other,
      and spring from the same causes.

      201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only
      gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only
      kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what
      seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no
      "morality of love to one's neighbour." Granted even that there is already
      a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,
      gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition of
      society all those instincts are already active which are latterly
      distinguished by honourable names as "virtues," and eventually almost
      coincide with the conception "morality": in that period they do not as yet
      belong to the domain of moral valuations—they are still ULTRA-MORAL.
      A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good nor bad, moral
      nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a
      sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the
      best, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which
      contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA. After all,
      "love to our neighbour" is always a secondary matter, partly conventional
      and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After
      the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against
      external dangers, it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new
      perspectives of moral valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts,
      such as the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness,
      rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had not only to be
      honoured from the point of view of general utility—under other
      names, of course, than those here given—but had to be fostered and
      cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger
      against the common enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be
      doubly strong—when the outlets for them are lacking—and are
      gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny. The contrary
      instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious
      instinct gradually draws its conclusions. How much or how little
      dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion,
      a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment—that is now
      the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother of morals. It is by
      the loftiest and strongest instincts, when they break out passionately and
      carry the individual far above and beyond the average, and the low level
      of the gregarious conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is
      destroyed, its belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks,
      consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The
      lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the
      cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the
      individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is
      henceforth called EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting,
      self-equalizing disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral
      distinction and honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there
      is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to
      severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice,
      begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and
      self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, "the lamb," and
      still more "the sheep," wins respect. There is a point of diseased
      mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society
      itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and
      does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it to be
      somehow unfair—it is certain that the idea of "punishment" and "the
      obligation to punish" are then painful and alarming to people. "Is it not
      sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we still
      punish? Punishment itself is terrible!"—with these questions
      gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate conclusion.
      If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear, one would have
      done away with this morality at the same time, it would no longer be
      necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer necessary!—Whoever
      examines the conscience of the present-day European, will always elicit
      the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses, the
      imperative of the timidity of the herd "we wish that some time or other
      there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!" Some time or other—the will and
      the way THERETO is nowadays called "progress" all over Europe.

<p>
      202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times,
      for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths—OUR
      truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly,
      and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will be
      accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to men of
      "modern ideas" that we have constantly applied the terms "herd,"
      "herd-instincts," and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot
      do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We have
      found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become
      unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence
      prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he did not
      know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teach—they
      "know" today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard and be
      distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which here thinks
      it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame, and
      calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the
      instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to
      preponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to the
      increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the
      symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and
      therefore, as we understand the matter, only one kind of human morality,
      beside which, before which, and after which many other moralities, and
      above all HIGHER moralities, are or should be possible. Against such a
      "possibility," against such a "should be," however, this morality defends
      itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and inexorably "I am
      morality itself and nothing else is morality!" Indeed, with the help of a
      religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the
      herding-animal, things have reached such a point that we always find a
      more visible expression of this morality even in political and social
      arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the Christian
      movement. That its TEMPO, however, is much too slow and sleepy for the
      more impatient ones, for those who are sick and distracted by the
      herding-instinct, is indicated by the increasingly furious howling, and
      always less disguised teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now
      roving through the highways of European culture. Apparently in opposition
      to the peacefully industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and
      still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries
      who call themselves Socialists and want a "free society," those are really
      at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every
      form of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even
      of repudiating the notions "master" and "servant"—ni dieu ni maitre,
      says a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every
      special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately
      opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs "rights"
      any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it
      were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of all
      former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy, in
      their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very
      animals, up even to "God"—the extravagance of "sympathy for God"
      belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and impatience
      of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering generally, in their
      almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or ALLOWING it; at one in
      their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening, under the spell of which
      Europe seems to be threatened with a new Buddhism; at one in their belief
      in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as though it were morality in itself,
      the climax, the ATTAINED climax of mankind, the sole hope of the future,
      the consolation of the present, the great discharge from all the
      obligations of the past; altogether at one in their belief in the
      community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and therefore in "themselves."
    </p>
<p>
      203. We, who hold a different belief—we, who regard the democratic
      movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but
      as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his
      mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In NEW
      PHILOSOPHERS—there is no other alternative: in minds strong and
      original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue and
      invert "eternal valuations"; in forerunners, in men of the future, who in
      the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will
      compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future of humanity
      as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make preparation for vast
      hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating, in
      order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance
      which has hitherto gone by the name of "history" (the folly of the
      "greatest number" is only its last form)—for that purpose a new type
      of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed, at the
      very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult,
      terrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed. The image of
      such leaders hovers before OUR eyes:—is it lawful for me to say it
      aloud, ye free spirits? The conditions which one would partly have to
      create and partly utilize for their genesis; the presumptive methods and
      tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and
      power as to feel a CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values,
      under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled
      and a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such
      responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the
      dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:—these
      are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits! these
      are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of
      OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or
      experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated;
      but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of "man" himself
      DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the extraordinary
      fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future
      of mankind—a game in which neither the hand, nor even a "finger of
      God" has participated!—he who divines the fate that is hidden under
      the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of "modern ideas," and still
      more under the whole of Christo-European morality—suffers from an
      anguish with which no other is to be compared. He sees at a glance all
      that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through a favourable accumulation and
      augmentation of human powers and arrangements; he knows with all the
      knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest
      possibilities, and how often in the past the type man has stood in
      presence of mysterious decisions and new paths:—he knows still
      better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles
      promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to
      pieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. The UNIVERSAL
      DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of the "man of the future"—as
      idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-pates—this degeneracy
      and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal (or as they call
      it, to a man of "free society"), this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with
      equal rights and claims, is undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out
      this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown
      to the rest of mankind—and perhaps also a new MISSION!

      CHAPTER VI. WE SCHOLARS

      204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which
      it has always been—namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES, according
      to Balzac—I would venture to protest against an improper and
      injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the
      best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations
      of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right out
      of one's own EXPERIENCE—experience, as it seems to me, always
      implies unfortunate experience?—to treat of such an important
      question of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST
      science like women and artists ("Ah! this dreadful science!" sigh their
      instinct and their shame, "it always FINDS THINGS OUT!"). The declaration
      of independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy,
      is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and
      disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of the
      learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtime—which
      does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet. Here
      also the instinct of the populace cries, "Freedom from all masters!" and
      after science has, with the happiest results, resisted theology, whose
      "hand-maid" it had been too long, it now proposes in its wantonness and
      indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy, and in its turn to play the
      "master"—what am I saying! to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own
      account. My memory—the memory of a scientific man, if you please!—teems
      with the naivetes of insolence which I have heard about philosophy and
      philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the
      most cultured and most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and
      schoolmasters, who are both the one and the other by profession). On one
      occasion it was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood
      on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another
      time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and
      refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt
      himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the
      colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but a
      series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which "does
      nobody any good". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of
      the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another time
      the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended
      to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most frequently,
      behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars, the evil
      after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the whole
      obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his scornful
      estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of—the result
      being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to me, for
      instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by
      his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing the
      whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection with German
      culture, which culture, all things considered, has been an elevation and a
      divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but precisely at this point
      Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive, and un-German to the extent of
      ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking generally, it may just have been
      the humanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers themselves, in
      short, their contemptibleness, which has injured most radically the
      reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the
      populace. Let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world
      diverges from the whole style of the world of Heraclitus, Plato,
      Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of
      the spirit were called, and with what justice an honest man of science MAY
      feel himself of a better family and origin, in view of such
      representatives of philosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present
      day, are just as much aloft as they are down below—in Germany, for
      instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring and the
      amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially the sight of those
      hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves "realists," or
      "positivists," which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the
      soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers, at the best, are
      themselves but scholars and specialists, that is very evident! All of them
      are persons who have been vanquished and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the
      dominion of science, who at one time or another claimed more from
      themselves, without having a right to the "more" and its responsibility—and
      who now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in word and
      deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task and supremacy of philosophy After all,
      how could it be otherwise? Science flourishes nowadays and has the good
      conscience clearly visible on its countenance, while that to which the
      entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of
      the present day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity
      Philosophy reduced to a "theory of knowledge," no more in fact than a
      diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that
      never even gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the
      right to enter—that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an
      agony, something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophy—RULE!
    </p>
<p>
      205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact,
      so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still
      come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the sciences have
      increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the
      philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself
      somewhere and "specialize" so that he will no longer attain to his
      elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and
      his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his maturity
      and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and deteriorated,
      so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no longer of much
      importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual
      conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way, he dreads the
      temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows
      too well that as a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer
      commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a great
      play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat-catcher—in
      short, a misleader. This is in the last instance a question of taste, if
      it has not really been a question of conscience. To double once more the
      philosopher's difficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from
      himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning
      life and the worth of life—he learns unwillingly to believe that it
      is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to seek
      his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive
      (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often hesitating,
      doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the philosopher has long been mistaken
      and confused by the multitude, either with the scientific man and ideal
      scholar, or with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized
      visionary and God-intoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody
      praised, because he lives "wisely," or "as a philosopher," it hardly means
      anything more than "prudently and apart." Wisdom: that seems to the
      populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing
      successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher—does it
      not seem so to US, my friends?—lives "unphilosophically" and
      "unwisely," above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of
      a hundred attempts and temptations of life—he risks HIMSELF
      constantly, he plays THIS bad game.

      206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either
      ENGENDERS or PRODUCES—both words understood in their fullest sense—the
      man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of the
      old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two
      principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and to the
      old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of indemnification—in
      these cases one emphasizes the respectability—and yet, in the
      compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture of vexation. Let
      us examine more closely: what is the scientific man? Firstly, a
      commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to say, a
      non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type of man; he
      possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file, equability and
      moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the instinct for people
      like himself, and for that which they require—for instance: the
      portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest
      from labour, the claim to honour and consideration (which first and
      foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a
      good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with
      which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart of all
      dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again to be overcome.
      The learned man, as is appropriate, has also maladies and faults of an
      ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has a lynx-eye for the weak
      points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain. He is
      confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go, but does not FLOW; and
      precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and
      more reserved—his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake,
      which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy. The worst and most
      dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of
      mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of mediocrity, which labours
      instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man, and endeavours
      to break—or still better, to relax—every bent bow To relax, of
      course, with consideration, and naturally with an indulgent hand—to
      RELAX with confiding sympathy that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has
      always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.

<p>
      207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit—and who
      has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded
      IPSISIMOSITY!—in the end, however, one must learn caution even with
      regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with which
      the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been
      celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation and
      glorification—as is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist
      school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest
      honours to "disinterested knowledge" The objective man, who no longer
      curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning in whom
      the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and
      partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that
      exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful He is only
      an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR—he is no "purpose in
      himself" The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration
      before everything that wants to be known, with such desires only as
      knowing or "reflecting" implies—he waits until something comes, and
      then expands himself sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and
      gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film
      Whatever "personality" he still possesses seems to him accidental,
      arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he come to regard
      himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events He calls
      up the recollection of "himself" with an effort, and not infrequently
      wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other persons, he makes
      mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and
      negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the pettiness and
      confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack of companions and
      society—indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his suffering, but in
      vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE GENERAL case, and
      tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself He
      does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is
      serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping
      and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual complaisance with respect to all
      objects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality with which
      he receives everything that comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate
      good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are
      enough of cases in which he has to atone for these virtues of his!—and
      as man generally, he becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such
      virtues. Should one wish love or hatred from him—I mean love and
      hatred as God, woman, and animal understand them—he will do what he
      can, and furnish what he can. But one must not be surprised if it should
      not be much—if he should show himself just at this point to be
      false, fragile, questionable, and deteriorated. His love is constrained,
      his hatred is artificial, and rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight
      ostentation and exaggeration. He is only genuine so far as he can be
      objective; only in his serene totality is he still "nature" and "natural."
      His mirroring and eternally self-polishing soul no longer knows how to
      affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not command; neither does he
      destroy. "JE NE MEPRISE PRESQUE RIEN"—he says, with Leibniz: let us
      not overlook nor undervalue the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he
      does not go in advance of any one, nor after, either; he places himself
      generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either
      good or evil. If he has been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with
      the Caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has had far too
      much honour, and what is more essential in him has been overlooked—he
      is an instrument, something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest
      sort of slave, but nothing in himself—PRESQUE RIEN! The objective
      man is an instrument, a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring
      instrument and mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and
      respected; but he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary
      man in whom the REST of existence justifies itself, no termination—and
      still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing
      hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a
      soft, inflated, delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some
      kind of content and frame to "shape" itself thereto—for the most
      part a man without frame and content, a "selfless" man. Consequently,
      also, nothing for women, IN PARENTHESI.

      208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic—I
      hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the
      objective spirit?—people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on
      that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many, many
      questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he
      is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of skepticism, it
      seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening sound in the
      distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere, a
      dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian NIHILINE, a
      pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means denial, but—dreadful
      thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of "good-will"—a will
      to the veritable, actual negation of life—there is, as is generally
      acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than skepticism,
      the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and Hamlet himself is now
      prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the "spirit," and
      its underground noises. "Are not our ears already full of bad sounds?" say
      the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and almost as a kind of safety police;
      "this subterranean Nay is terrible! Be still, ye pessimistic moles!" The
      skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily frightened;
      his conscience is schooled so as to start at every Nay, and even at that
      sharp, decided Yea, and feels something like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!—they
      seem to him opposed to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a
      festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with
      Montaigne: "What do I know?" Or with Socrates: "I know that I know
      nothing." Or: "Here I do not trust myself, no door is open to me." Or:
      "Even if the door were open, why should I enter immediately?" Or: "What is
      the use of any hasty hypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to
      make no hypotheses at all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at
      once what is crooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is
      there not time enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons,
      can ye not at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx,
      too, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher."—Thus does a
      skeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For
      skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided
      physiological temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous
      debility and sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have
      been long separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In
      the new generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and
      valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and
      tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues
      prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast, and
      perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however, which
      is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the WILL; they
      are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or the courageous
      feeling of pleasure in willing—they are doubtful of the "freedom of
      the will" even in their dreams Our present-day Europe, the scene of a
      senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes, and
      CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its heights and
      depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs
      impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with gloomy
      aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs—and often
      sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not find this
      cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How seductively
      ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this
      disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself nowadays in
      the show-cases as "objectiveness," "the scientific spirit," "L'ART POUR
      L'ART," and "pure voluntary knowledge," is only decked-out skepticism and
      paralysis of will—I am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the
      European disease—The disease of the will is diffused unequally over
      Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest
      prevailed, it decreases according as "the barbarian" still—or again—asserts
      his claims under the loose drapery of Western culture It is therefore in
      the France of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended, that
      the will is most infirm, and France, which has always had a masterly
      aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into
      something charming and seductive, now manifests emphatically its
      intellectual ascendancy over Europe, by being the school and exhibition of
      all the charms of skepticism The power to will and to persist, moreover,
      in a resolution, is already somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the
      North of Germany it is stronger than in Central Germany, it is
      considerably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with
      phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter—not to
      mention Italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants, and must
      first show whether it can exercise will, but it is strongest and most
      surprising of all in that immense middle empire where Europe as it were
      flows back to Asia—namely, in Russia There the power to will has
      been long stored up and accumulated, there the will—uncertain
      whether to be negative or affirmative—waits threateningly to be
      discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists) Perhaps not
      only Indian wars and complications in Asia would be necessary to free
      Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the
      shattering of the empire into small states, and above all the introduction
      of parliamentary imbecility, together with the obligation of every one to
      read his newspaper at breakfast I do not say this as one who desires it,
      in my heart I should rather prefer the contrary—I mean such an
      increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to
      make up its mind to become equally threatening—namely, TO ACQUIRE
      ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a
      persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of
      years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and
      its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be
      brought to a close. The time for petty politics is past; the next century
      will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world—the COMPULSION
      to great politics.
    </p>
<p>
      209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have
      evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger
      kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily merely
      by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already understand.
      That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of
      Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical genius—and
      therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged type of
      German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great, had on one
      point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what was then
      lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times more alarming
      and serious than any lack of culture and social form—his ill-will to
      the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct. MEN
      WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son
      was not man enough. There, however, he deceived himself; but who would not
      have deceived himself in his place? He saw his son lapsed to atheism, to
      the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever Frenchmen—he saw in
      the background the great bloodsucker, the spider skepticism; he suspected
      the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for
      evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer commands, is no longer
      ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new
      kind of harder and more dangerous skepticism—who knows TO WHAT
      EXTENT it was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy
      melancholy of a will condemned to solitude?—the skepticism of daring
      manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest,
      and made its first entrance into Germany in the person of the great
      Frederick. This skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps; it undermines
      and takes possession; it does not believe, but it does not thereby lose
      itself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard
      over the heart. It is the GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued
      Fredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a
      considerable time under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical
      and historical distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough
      masculine character of the great German philologists and historical
      critics (who, rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of
      destruction and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit
      gradually established itself—in spite of all Romanticism in music
      and philosophy—in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was
      decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as
      courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to
      dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions
      under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when
      warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this
      spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet
      calls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how
      characteristic is this fear of the "man" in the German spirit which
      awakened Europe out of its "dogmatic slumber," let us call to mind the
      former conception which had to be overcome by this new one—and that
      it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with
      unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of Europe
      as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools. Finally, let us
      only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's astonishment when he saw
      Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for centuries as the "German
      spirit" "VOILA UN HOMME!"—that was as much as to say "But this is a
      MAN! And I only expected to see a German!"
    </p>
<p>
      210. Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the
      future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be
      skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be
      designated thereby—and not they themselves. With equal right they
      might call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of
      experiments. By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have
      already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting
      is this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use
      of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In
      their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and
      painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic
      century can approve of?—There is no doubt these coming ones will be
      least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities
      which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to
      standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method, the
      wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for
      self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in
      denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how
      to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds They
      will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only) than
      humane people may desire, they will not deal with the "truth" in order
      that it may "please" them, or "elevate" and "inspire" them—they will
      rather have little faith in "TRUTH" bringing with it such revels for the
      feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one says in
      their presence "That thought elevates me, why should it not be true?" or
      "That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?" or "That artist
      enlarges me, why should he not be great?" Perhaps they will not only have
      a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous, idealistic,
      feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one could look into their inmost
      hearts, he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile
      "Christian sentiments" with "antique taste," or even with "modern
      parliamentarism" (the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among
      philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory
      century). Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to purity and
      rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be demanded from themselves
      by these philosophers of the future, they may even make a display thereof
      as their special adornment—nevertheless they will not want to be
      called critics on that account. It will seem to them no small indignity to
      philosophy to have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that "philosophy
      itself is criticism and critical science—and nothing else whatever!"
      Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the
      Positivists of France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the
      heart and taste of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal
      works), our new philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are
      instruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments,
      they are far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman
      of Konigsberg was only a great critic.
    </p>
<p>
      211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical
      workers, and in general scientific men, with philosophers—that
      precisely here one should strictly give "each his own," and not give those
      far too much, these far too little. It may be necessary for the education
      of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all
      those steps upon which his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy,
      remain standing, and MUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have
      been critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and
      collector, and traveler, and riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and
      "free spirit," and almost everything, in order to traverse the whole range
      of human values and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of
      eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth
      up to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only
      preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something
      else—it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers,
      after the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize
      some great existing body of valuations—that is to say, former
      DETERMINATIONS OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent,
      and are for a time called "truths"—whether in the domain of the
      LOGICAL, the POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these
      investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto,
      conspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten
      everything long, even "time" itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an
      immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined
      pride, all tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL
      PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: "Thus
      SHALL it be!" They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and
      thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and
      all subjugators of the past—they grasp at the future with a creative
      hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an
      instrument, and a hammer. Their "knowing" is CREATING, their creating is a
      law-giving, their will to truth is—WILL TO POWER.—Are there at
      present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers? MUST
      there not be such philosophers some day? ...
    </p>
<p>
      212. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man
      INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever found
      himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction to the day
      in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his day.
      Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls
      philosophers—who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but
      rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators—have found
      their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,
      however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of
      their age. In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very
      VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been for
      the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to his
      aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence,
      self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under
      the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was
      OUTLIVED, they have always said "We must remove hence to where YOU are
      least at home" In the face of a world of "modern ideas," which would like
      to confine every one in a corner, in a "specialty," a philosopher, if
      there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled to place the
      greatness of man, the conception of "greatness," precisely in his
      comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would
      even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that
      which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the EXTENT to
      which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the taste and virtue
      of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is so adapted to the
      spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in the ideal of the
      philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity for prolonged
      resolution, must specially be included in the conception of "greatness",
      with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly,
      renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite age—such
      as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its accumulated energy of
      will, and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness In the time
      of Socrates, among men only of worn-out instincts, old conservative
      Athenians who let themselves go—"for the sake of happiness," as they
      said, for the sake of pleasure, as their conduct indicated—and who
      had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long
      forfeited the right by the life they led, IRONY was perhaps necessary for
      greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic assurance of the old physician and
      plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as into the flesh and
      heart of the "noble," with a look that said plainly enough "Do not
      dissemble before me! here—we are equal!" At present, on the
      contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal alone attains to
      honours, and dispenses honours, when "equality of right" can too readily
      be transformed into equality in wrong—I mean to say into general war
      against everything rare, strange, and privileged, against the higher man,
      the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative
      plenipotence and lordliness—at present it belongs to the conception
      of "greatness" to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be capable of being
      different, to stand alone, to have to live by personal initiative, and the
      philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts "He
      shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary, the most concealed,
      the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his
      virtues, and of super-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called
      GREATNESS: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be full." And
      to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLE—nowadays?
    </p>
<p>
      213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be
      taught: one must "know" it by experience—or one should have the
      pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things
      of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially and
      unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters:—the
      very few know them, are permitted to know them, and all popular ideas
      about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical
      combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace,
      and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is unknown
      to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore,
      should any one speak of it in their presence, it is incredible to them.
      They conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as a painful compulsory
      obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as
      something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as
      "worthy of the SWEAT of the noble"—but not at all as something easy
      and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! "To think" and to
      take a matter "seriously," "arduously"—that is one and the same
      thing to them; such only has been their "experience."—Artists have
      here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely
      when they no longer do anything "arbitrarily," and everything of
      necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively
      fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax—in short, that
      necessity and "freedom of will" are then the same thing with them. There
      is, in fine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the
      gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems
      repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being
      predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his
      spirituality. Of what use is it for nimble, everyday intellects, or
      clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press, in their plebeian
      ambition, close to such problems, and as it were into this "holy of
      holies"—as so often happens nowadays! But coarse feet must never
      tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in the primary law of
      things; the doors remain closed to those intruders, though they may dash
      and break their heads thereon. People have always to be born to a high
      station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has
      only a right to philosophy—taking the word in its higher
      significance—in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the "blood,"
      decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the way for the
      coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been separately
      acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the bold, easy,
      delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all the readiness
      for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance and contemning
      look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and
      virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and
      calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and practice of supreme
      justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of will, the lingering eye
      which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely loves....

      CHAPTER VII. OUR VIRTUES
    </h2>
<p>
      214. OUR Virtues?—It is probable that we, too, have still our
      virtues, although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues
      on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a
      little distance from us. We Europeans of the day after tomorrow, we
      firstlings of the twentieth century—with all our dangerous
      curiosity, our multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and
      seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit—we shall presumably,
      IF we must have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with
      our most secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent
      requirements: well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths!—where,
      as we know, so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost!
      And is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues? Is it
      not almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues? But this "believing in one's
      own virtues"—is it not practically the same as what was formerly
      called one's "good conscience," that long, respectable pigtail of an idea,
      which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough
      also behind their understandings? It seems, therefore, that however little
      we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly respectable
      in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy
      grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans with good
      consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.—Ah! if you only knew
      how soon, so very soon—it will be different!
    </p>
<p>
      215. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which
      determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different
      colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with green,
      and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours: so we
      modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our "firmament," are
      determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in
      different colours, and are seldom unequivocal—and there are often
      cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.
    </p>
<p>
      216. To love one's enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it takes
      place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed, at
      times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:—we learn to DESPISE
      when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however,
      unconsciously, without noise, without ostentation, with the shame and
      secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and
      the formula of virtue. Morality as attitude—is opposed to our taste
      nowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers
      that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste,
      including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion (and all
      that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime). It is the music in our
      conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral
      sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime.
    </p>
<p>
      217. Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance
      to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment! They
      never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE us (or even with
      REGARD to us)—they inevitably become our instinctive calumniators
      and detractors, even when they still remain our "friends."—Blessed
      are the forgetful: for they "get the better" even of their blunders.
    </p>
<p>
      218. The psychologists of France—and where else are there still
      psychologists nowadays?—have never yet exhausted their bitter and
      manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though... in short,
      they betray something thereby. Flaubert, for instance, the honest citizen
      of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the end; it was
      his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. As this is growing
      wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else for a
      pleasure—namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat,
      honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks
      they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which is
      a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the
      middle-class in its best moments—subtler even than the understanding
      of its victims:—a repeated proof that "instinct" is the most
      intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been
      discovered. In short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the
      "rule" in its struggle with the "exception": there you have a spectacle
      fit for Gods and godlike malignity! Or, in plainer words, practise
      vivisection on "good people," on the "homo bonae voluntatis," ON
      YOURSELVES!
    </p>
<p>
      219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite
      revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is also
      a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature, and finally,
      it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING subtle—malice
      spiritualises. They are glad in their inmost heart that there is a
      standard according to which those who are over-endowed with intellectual
      goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for the "equality of
      all before God," and almost NEED the belief in God for this purpose. It is
      among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found. If any
      one were to say to them "A lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison
      with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral man"—it would
      make them furious, I shall take care not to say so. I would rather flatter
      them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the
      ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis of all
      qualities attributed to the "merely moral" man, after they have been
      acquired singly through long training and practice, perhaps during a whole
      series of generations, that lofty spirituality is precisely the
      spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity which knows that it
      is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the world, even among
      things—and not only among men.
    </p>
<p>
      220. Now that the praise of the "disinterested person" is so popular one
      must—probably not without some danger—get an idea of WHAT
      people actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally
      which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men—including
      the cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if
      appearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the
      greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more refined
      and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely "uninteresting" to the average man—if,
      notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these interests, he calls it
      desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to act "disinterestedly."
      There have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a
      seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did
      not know the higher nature by experience?), instead of stating the naked
      and candidly reasonable truth that "disinterested" action is very
      interesting and "interested" action, provided that... "And love?"—What!
      Even an action for love's sake shall be "unegoistic"? But you fools—!
      "And the praise of the self-sacrificer?"—But whoever has really
      offered sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it—perhaps
      something from himself for something from himself; that he relinquished
      here in order to have more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even
      feel himself "more." But this is a realm of questions and answers in which
      a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to
      stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to answer. And after all,
      truth is a woman; one must not use force with her.
    </p>
<p>
      221. "It sometimes happens," said a moralistic pedant and trifle-retailer,
      "that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not, however, because he is
      unselfish, but because I think he has a right to be useful to another man
      at his own expense. In short, the question is always who HE is, and who
      THE OTHER is. For instance, in a person created and destined for command,
      self-denial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the
      waste of virtues: so it seems to me. Every system of unegoistic morality
      which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins
      against good taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an
      ADDITIONAL seduction under the mask of philanthropy—and precisely a
      seduction and injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of
      men. Moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the
      GRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their
      conscience—until they thoroughly understand at last that it is
      IMMORAL to say that 'what is right for one is proper for another.'"—So
      said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme. Did he perhaps deserve to be
      laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise morality?
      But one should not be too much in the right if one wishes to have the
      laughers on ONE'S OWN side; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste.
    </p>
<p>
      222. Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays—and,
      if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer preached—let
      the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity, through all
      the noise which is natural to these preachers (as to all preachers), he
      will hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine note of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs to
      the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe, which has been on the increase
      for a century (the first symptoms of which are already specified
      documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame d'Epinay)—IF
      IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF! The man of "modern ideas," the
      conceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with himself—this is
      perfectly certain. He suffers, and his vanity wants him only "to suffer
      with his fellows."
    </p>
<p>
      223. The hybrid European—a tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in all—absolutely
      requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroom of costumes. To be
      sure, he notices that none of the costumes fit him properly—he
      changes and changes. Let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to
      these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style, and also
      with respect to its moments of desperation on account of "nothing suiting"
      us. It is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic, or classical, or
      Christian, or Florentine, or barocco, or "national," in moribus et
      artibus: it does not "clothe us"! But the "spirit," especially the
      "historical spirit," profits even by this desperation: once and again a
      new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested, put on, taken off,
      packed up, and above all studied—we are the first studious age in
      puncto of "costumes," I mean as concerns morals, articles of belief,
      artistic tastes, and religions; we are prepared as no other age has ever
      been for a carnival in the grand style, for the most spiritual festival—laughter
      and arrogance, for the transcendental height of supreme folly and
      Aristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps we are still discovering the
      domain of our invention just here, the domain where even we can still be
      original, probably as parodists of the world's history and as God's
      Merry-Andrews,—perhaps, though nothing else of the present have a
      future, our laughter itself may have a future!
    </p>
<p>
      224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order
      of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a community, or an
      individual has lived, the "divining instinct" for the relationships of
      these valuations, for the relation of the authority of the valuations to
      the authority of the operating forces),—this historical sense, which
      we Europeans claim as our specialty, has come to us in the train of the
      enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which Europe has been plunged by
      the democratic mingling of classes and races—it is only the
      nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth sense.
      Owing to this mingling, the past of every form and mode of life, and of
      cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one
      another, flows forth into us "modern souls"; our instincts now run back in
      all directions, we ourselves are a kind of chaos: in the end, as we have
      said, the spirit perceives its advantage therein. By means of our
      semi-barbarity in body and in desire, we have secret access everywhere,
      such as a noble age never had; we have access above all to the labyrinth
      of imperfect civilizations, and to every form of semi-barbarity that has
      at any time existed on earth; and in so far as the most considerable part
      of human civilization hitherto has just been semi-barbarity, the
      "historical sense" implies almost the sense and instinct for everything,
      the taste and tongue for everything: whereby it immediately proves itself
      to be an IGNOBLE sense. For instance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is
      perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer,
      whom men of distinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth
      century, like Saint-Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and
      even Voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so
      easily appropriate—whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy.
      The very decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready
      disgust, their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange,
      their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the
      averseness of every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new
      desire, a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what
      is strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even
      towards the best things of the world which are not their property or could
      not become their prey—and no faculty is more unintelligible to such
      men than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian
      curiosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous
      Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian of
      the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter or
      irritation: but we—accept precisely this wild motleyness, this
      medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial,
      with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement of
      art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little
      disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English populace
      in which Shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on the Chiaja of
      Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way, enchanted and
      voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower quarters of the
      town. That as men of the "historical sense" we have our virtues, is not to
      be disputed:—we are unpretentious, unselfish, modest, brave,
      habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very grateful, very
      patient, very complaisant—but with all this we are perhaps not very
      "tasteful." Let us finally confess it, that what is most difficult for us
      men of the "historical sense" to grasp, feel, taste, and love, what finds
      us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile, is precisely the
      perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art, the essentially
      noble in works and men, their moment of smooth sea and halcyon
      self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness which all things show that
      have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great virtue of the historical
      sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste, at least to the very bad
      taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly, hesitatingly, and
      with compulsion the small, short, and happy godsends and glorifications of
      human life as they shine here and there: those moments and marvelous
      experiences when a great power has voluntarily come to a halt before the
      boundless and infinite,—when a super-abundance of refined delight
      has been enjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying, by standing firmly
      and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS
      is strange to us, let us confess it to ourselves; our itching is really
      the itching for the infinite, the immeasurable. Like the rider on his
      forward panting horse, we let the reins fall before the infinite, we
      modern men, we semi-barbarians—and are only in OUR highest bliss
      when we—ARE IN MOST DANGER.
    </p>
<p>
      225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism,
      all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to
      PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to accompanying circumstances and
      secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and naivetes,
      which every one conscious of CREATIVE powers and an artist's conscience
      will look down upon with scorn, though not without sympathy. Sympathy for
      you!—to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand it: it is
      not sympathy for social "distress," for "society" with its sick and
      misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the
      ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumbling, vexed,
      revolutionary slave-classes who strive after power—they call it
      "freedom." OUR sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy:—we
      see how MAN dwarfs himself, how YOU dwarf him! and there are moments when
      we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish, when we resist it,—when
      we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity. You
      want, if possible—and there is not a more foolish "if possible"—TO
      DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?—it really seems that WE would rather
      have it increased and made worse than it has ever been! Well-being, as you
      understand it—is certainly not a goal; it seems to us an END; a
      condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptible—and
      makes his destruction DESIRABLE! The discipline of suffering, of GREAT
      suffering—know ye not that it is only THIS discipline that has
      produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto? The tension of soul in
      misfortune which communicates to it its energy, its shuddering in view of
      rack and ruin, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring,
      interpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and whatever depth, mystery,
      disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has been bestowed upon the soul—has
      it not been bestowed through suffering, through the discipline of great
      suffering? In man CREATURE and CREATOR are united: in man there is not
      only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire, folly, chaos; but there is also
      the creator, the sculptor, the hardness of the hammer, the divinity of the
      spectator, and the seventh day—do ye understand this contrast? And
      that YOUR sympathy for the "creature in man" applies to that which has to
      be fashioned, bruised, forged, stretched, roasted, annealed, refined—to
      that which must necessarily SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer? And our
      sympathy—do ye not understand what our REVERSE sympathy applies to,
      when it resists your sympathy as the worst of all pampering and
      enervation?—So it is sympathy AGAINST sympathy!—But to repeat
      it once more, there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and
      pain and sympathy; and all systems of philosophy which deal only with
      these are naivetes.
    </p>
<p>
      226. WE IMMORALISTS.—This world with which WE are concerned, in
      which we have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible world of
      delicate command and delicate obedience, a world of "almost" in every
      respect, captious, insidious, sharp, and tender—yes, it is well
      protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity! We are woven into
      a strong net and garment of duties, and CANNOT disengage ourselves—precisely
      here, we are "men of duty," even we! Occasionally, it is true, we dance in
      our "chains" and betwixt our "swords"; it is none the less true that more
      often we gnash our teeth under the circumstances, and are impatient at the
      secret hardship of our lot. But do what we will, fools and appearances say
      of us: "These are men WITHOUT duty,"—we have always fools and
      appearances against us!
    </p>
<p>
      227. Honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid
      ourselves, we free spirits—well, we will labour at it with all our
      perversity and love, and not tire of "perfecting" ourselves in OUR virtue,
      which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread like a gilded,
      blue, mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull gloomy
      seriousness! And if, nevertheless, our honesty should one day grow weary,
      and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and would fain have
      it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable vice, let us remain
      HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its help whatever devilry we
      have in us:—our disgust at the clumsy and undefined, our "NITIMUR IN
      VETITUM," our love of adventure, our sharpened and fastidious curiosity,
      our most subtle, disguised, intellectual Will to Power and universal
      conquest, which rambles and roves avidiously around all the realms of the
      future—let us go with all our "devils" to the help of our "God"! It
      is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account:
      what does it matter! They will say: "Their 'honesty'—that is their
      devilry, and nothing else!" What does it matter! And even if they were
      right—have not all Gods hitherto been such sanctified, re-baptized
      devils? And after all, what do we know of ourselves? And what the spirit
      that leads us wants TO BE CALLED? (It is a question of names.) And how
      many spirits we harbour? Our honesty, we free spirits—let us be
      careful lest it become our vanity, our ornament and ostentation, our
      limitation, our stupidity! Every virtue inclines to stupidity, every
      stupidity to virtue; "stupid to the point of sanctity," they say in
      Russia,—let us be careful lest out of pure honesty we eventually
      become saints and bores! Is not life a hundred times too short for us—to
      bore ourselves? One would have to believe in eternal life in order to...

      228. I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy
      hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific appliances—and
      that "virtue," in my opinion, has been MORE injured by the TEDIOUSNESS of
      its advocates than by anything else; at the same time, however, I would
      not wish to overlook their general usefulness. It is desirable that as few
      people as possible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very
      desirable that morals should not some day become interesting! But let us
      not be afraid! Things still remain today as they have always been: I see
      no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES) an idea of the fact that
      philosophizing concerning morals might be conducted in a dangerous,
      captious, and ensnaring manner—that CALAMITY might be involved
      therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable English
      utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they stalk on, stalk along
      (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the footsteps of Bentham, just
      as he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable Helvetius!
      (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius, CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to
      use an expression of Galiani). No new thought, nothing of the nature of a
      finer turning or better expression of an old thought, not even a proper
      history of what has been previously thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE
      literature, taking it all in all, unless one knows how to leaven it with
      some mischief. In effect, the old English vice called CANT, which is MORAL
      TARTUFFISM, has insinuated itself also into these moralists (whom one must
      certainly read with an eye to their motives if one MUST read them),
      concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover,
      there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pangs of
      conscience, from which a race of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in
      all their scientific tinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the
      opposite of a Puritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality
      as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is
      moralizing not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be
      recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the "general
      utility," or "the happiness of the greatest number,"—no! the
      happiness of ENGLAND, will be best served thereby. They would like, by all
      means, to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness, I
      mean after COMFORT and FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in
      Parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that in
      so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has just
      consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous,
      conscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the cause
      of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have any knowledge
      or inkling of the facts that the "general welfare" is no ideal, no goal,
      no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a nostrum,—that
      what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another, that the
      requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to higher men,
      in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man and man, and
      consequently between morality and morality. They are an unassuming and
      fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian Englishmen, and,
      as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one cannot think
      highly enough of their utility. One ought even to ENCOURAGE them, as has
      been partially attempted in the following rhymes:—
    </p>
<pre>
    Hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling,
    "Longer—better," aye revealing,

    Stiffer aye in head and knee;

      229. In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there
      still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the fear, of the
      "cruel wild beast," the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of
      these humaner ages—that even obvious truths, as if by the agreement
      of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the
      appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again. I
      perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; let others
      capture it again and give it so much "milk of pious sentiment" [FOOTNOTE:
      An expression from Schiller's William Tell, Act IV, Scene 3.] to drink,
      that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old corner.—One
      ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes; one ought at last
      to learn impatience, in order that such immodest gross errors—as,
      for instance, have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with
      regard to tragedy—may no longer wander about virtuously and boldly.
      Almost everything that we call "higher culture" is based upon the
      spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTY—this is my thesis; the
      "wild beast" has not been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has
      only been—transfigured. That which constitutes the painful delight
      of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in so-called tragic
      sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime, up to the highest
      and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its sweetness solely
      from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What the Roman enjoys in the
      arena, the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross, the Spaniard at the
      sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight, the present-day
      Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the Parisian
      suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions, the Wagnerienne
      who, with unhinged will, "undergoes" the performance of "Tristan and
      Isolde"—what all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious ardour to
      drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe "cruelty." Here, to be sure,
      we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times,
      which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the
      sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant
      enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in causing one's own suffering—and
      wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self-denial in the
      RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation, as among the Phoenicians and
      ascetics, or in general, to desensualisation, decarnalisation, and
      contrition, to Puritanical repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience
      and to Pascal-like SACRIFIZIA DELL' INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and
      impelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty
      TOWARDS HIMSELF.—Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of
      knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he
      compels his spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often
      enough against the wishes of his heart:—he forces it to say Nay,
      where he would like to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of
      taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an
      intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which
      instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality,—even in every
      desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty.
    </p>
<p>
      230. Perhaps what I have said here about a "fundamental will of the
      spirit" may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed a
      word of explanation.—That imperious something which is popularly
      called "the spirit," wishes to be master internally and externally, and to
      feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity, a
      binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will. Its requirements
      and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by physiologists to
      everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power of the spirit to
      appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to
      assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to overlook or
      repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it arbitrarily
      re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself certain traits
      and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of the "outside
      world." Its object thereby is the incorporation of new "experiences," the
      assortment of new things in the old arrangements—in short, growth;
      or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of increased power—is
      its object. This same will has at its service an apparently opposed
      impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of
      arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of this or
      that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive attitude against much
      that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity, with the shutting-in
      horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance: as that which is all
      necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power, its
      "digestive power," to speak figuratively (and in fact "the spirit"
      resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here also belong an
      occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps
      with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so, but is only allowed to
      pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an exulting
      enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and mystery, of the
      too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified, the diminished, the
      misshapen, the beautified—an enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all
      these manifestations of power. Finally, in this connection, there is the
      not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and
      dissemble before them—the constant pressing and straining of a
      creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit enjoys therein its
      craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of
      security therein—it is precisely by its Protean arts that it is best
      protected and concealed!—COUNTER TO this propensity for appearance,
      for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in short, for an outside—for
      every outside is a cloak—there operates the sublime tendency of the
      man of knowledge, which takes, and INSISTS on taking things profoundly,
      variously, and thoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual
      conscience and taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in
      himself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and hardened
      his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is accustomed to severe
      discipline and even severe words. He will say: "There is something cruel
      in the tendency of my spirit": let the virtuous and amiable try to
      convince him that it is not so! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead
      of our cruelty, perhaps our "extravagant honesty" were talked about,
      whispered about, and glorified—we free, VERY free spirits—and
      some day perhaps SUCH will actually be our—posthumous glory!
      Meanwhile—for there is plenty of time until then—we should be
      least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral
      verbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and
      its sprightly exuberance. They are beautiful, glistening, jingling,
      festive words: honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, sacrifice for
      knowledge, heroism of the truthful—there is something in them that
      makes one's heart swell with pride. But we anchorites and marmots have
      long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite's
      conscience, that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old
      false adornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and
      that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the terrible
      original text HOMO NATURA must again be recognized. In effect, to
      translate man back again into nature; to master the many vain and
      visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto
      been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to
      bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now,
      hardened by the discipline of science, stands before the OTHER forms of
      nature, with fearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the
      enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far
      too long: "Thou art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!"—this
      may be a strange and foolish task, but that it is a TASK, who can deny!
      Why did we choose it, this foolish task? Or, to put the question
      differently: "Why knowledge at all?" Every one will ask us about this. And
      thus pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times,
      have not found and cannot find any better answer....
    </p>
<p>
      231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not
      merely "conserve"—as the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of
      our souls, quite "down below," there is certainly something unteachable, a
      granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to
      predetermined, chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaks an
      unchangeable "I am this"; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman,
      for instance, but can only learn fully—he can only follow to the end
      what is "fixed" about them in himself. Occasionally we find certain
      solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they are
      henceforth called "convictions." Later on—one sees in them only
      footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we ourselves
      ARE—or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody, our
      spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite "down below."—In view
      of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission will
      perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about "woman as
      she is," provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are
      merely—MY truths.
    </p>
<p>
      232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to enlighten
      men about "woman as she is"—THIS is one of the worst developments of
      the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must these clumsy attempts of
      feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring to light! Woman has so
      much cause for shame; in woman there is so much pedantry, superficiality,
      schoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and indiscretion
      concealed—study only woman's behaviour towards children!—which
      has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the FEAR of man.
      Alas, if ever the "eternally tedious in woman"—she has plenty of it!—is
      allowed to venture forth! if she begins radically and on principle to
      unlearn her wisdom and art-of charming, of playing, of frightening away
      sorrow, of alleviating and taking easily; if she forgets her delicate
      aptitude for agreeable desires! Female voices are already raised, which,
      by Saint Aristophanes! make one afraid:—with medical explicitness it
      is stated in a threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from
      man. Is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to
      be scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair,
      men's gift—we remained therewith "among ourselves"; and in the end,
      in view of all that women write about "woman," we may well have
      considerable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment about
      herself—and CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new
      ORNAMENT for herself—I believe ornamentation belongs to the
      eternally feminine?—why, then, she wishes to make herself feared:
      perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truth—what
      does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign,
      more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth—her great art is
      falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it,
      we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman:
      we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the company
      of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our
      seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to us.
      Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge
      profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it not
      true that on the whole "woman" has hitherto been most despised by woman
      herself, and not at all by us?—We men desire that woman should not
      continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was man's
      care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed: mulier
      taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon gave the
      too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in politicis!—and
      in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls out to women today:
      mulier taceat de mulierel.
    </p>
<p>
      233. It betrays corruption of the instincts—apart from the fact that
      it betrays bad taste—when a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame
      de Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby
      in favour of "woman as she is." Among men, these are the three comical
      women as they are—nothing more!—and just the best involuntary
      counter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.
    </p>
<p>
      234. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible thoughtlessness
      with which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is
      managed! Woman does not understand what food means, and she insists on
      being cook! If woman had been a thinking creature, she should certainly,
      as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the most important
      physiological facts, and should likewise have got possession of the
      healing art! Through bad female cooks—through the entire lack of
      reason in the kitchen—the development of mankind has been longest
      retarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very little
      better. A word to High School girls.
    </p>
<p>
      235. There are turns and casts of fancy, there are sentences, little
      handfuls of words, in which a whole culture, a whole society suddenly
      crystallises itself. Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de
      Lambert to her son: "MON AMI, NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES, QUI
      VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIR"—the motherliest and wisest remark, by the
      way, that was ever addressed to a son.
    </p>
<p>
      236. I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and
      Goethe believed about woman—the former when he sang, "ELLA GUARDAVA
      SUSO, ED IO IN LEI," and the latter when he interpreted it, "the eternally
      feminine draws us ALOFT"; for THIS is just what she believes of the
      eternally masculine.

<p>
      237A. Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which, losing
      their way, have come down among them from an elevation: as something
      delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating—but as
      something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.
    </p>
<p>
      238. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of "man and woman," to deny
      here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile
      tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal training, equal
      claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of shallow-mindedness; and
      a thinker who has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spot—shallow
      in instinct!—may generally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as
      betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove too "short" for all
      fundamental questions of life, future as well as present, and will be
      unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the other hand, a man who has
      depth of spirit as well as of desires, and has also the depth of
      benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness, and easily
      confounded with them, can only think of woman as ORIENTALS do: he must
      conceive of her as a possession, as confinable property, as a being
      predestined for service and accomplishing her mission therein—he
      must take his stand in this matter upon the immense rationality of Asia,
      upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia, as the Greeks did formerly;
      those best heirs and scholars of Asia—who, as is well known, with
      their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power, from Homer to the time of
      Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards woman, in short, more
      Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW humanely desirable this
      was, let us consider for ourselves!
    </p>
<p>
      239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much
      respect by men as at present—this belongs to the tendency and
      fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to
      old age—what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of
      this respect? They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute of
      respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights,
      indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is
      losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing taste.
      She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who "unlearns to fear"
      sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture forward
      when the fear-inspiring quality in man—or more definitely, the MAN
      in man—is no longer either desired or fully developed, is reasonable
      enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult to understand
      is that precisely thereby—woman deteriorates. This is what is
      happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the
      industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit,
      woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: "woman
      as clerkess" is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in
      course of formation. While she thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be
      "master," and inscribes "progress" of woman on her flags and banners, the
      very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN
      RETROGRADES. Since the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe
      has DECLINED in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims; and
      the "emancipation of woman," insofar as it is desired and demanded by
      women themselves (and not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to
      be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the
      most womanly instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost
      masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared woman—who is always a
      sensible woman—might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as
      to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect
      exercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man,
      perhaps even "to the book," where formerly she kept herself in control and
      in refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity
      man's faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something
      eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade
      man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and
      indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant domestic
      animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of
      servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing
      order of society has entailed and still entails (as though slavery were a
      counter-argument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of
      every elevation of culture):—what does all this betoken, if not a
      disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising? Certainly, there are
      enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses
      of the masculine sex, who advise woman to defeminize herself in this
      manner, and to imitate all the stupidities from which "man" in Europe,
      European "manliness," suffers,—who would like to lower woman to
      "general culture," indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with
      politics. Here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits
      and literary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be
      something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;—almost
      everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous
      kind of music (our latest German music), and she is daily being made more
      hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function,
      that of bearing robust children. They wish to "cultivate" her in general
      still more, and intend, as they say, to make the "weaker sex" STRONG by
      culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the
      "cultivating" of mankind and his weakening—that is to say, the
      weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL—have
      always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and
      influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon) had
      just to thank their force of will—and not their schoolmasters—for
      their power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect in woman,
      and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more "natural" than
      that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning flexibility, her
      tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism, her untrainableness
      and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of
      her desires and virtues. That which, in spite of fear, excites one's
      sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat, "woman," is that she seems
      more afflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more
      condemned to disillusionment than any other creature. Fear and sympathy it
      is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of
      woman, always with one foot already in tragedy, which rends while it
      delights—What? And all that is now to be at an end? And the
      DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The tediousness of woman is slowly
      evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know the horned animal which was always
      most attractive to thee, from which danger is ever again threatening thee!
      Thy old fable might once more become "history"—an immense stupidity
      might once again overmaster thee and carry thee away! And no God concealed
      beneath it—no! only an "idea," a "modern idea"!

      CHAPTER VIII. PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES
    </h2>
<p>
      240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture to
      the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy,
      latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music
      as still living, in order that it may be understood:—it is an honour
      to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours and
      forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It impresses
      us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and too
      modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it is not
      infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse—it has fire and
      courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits which
      ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a moment of
      inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause and effect,
      an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it
      broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight—the most
      manifold delight,—of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY the
      joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his astonished,
      happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed, the new,
      newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art which he apparently
      betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no South, nothing of the
      delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly
      a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as
      though the artist wished to say to us: "It is part of my intention"; a
      cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious, a
      flirring of learned and venerable conceits and witticisms; something
      German in the best and worst sense of the word, something in the German
      style, manifold, formless, and inexhaustible; a certain German potency and
      super-plenitude of soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the
      RAFFINEMENTS of decadence—which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease
      there; a real, genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time
      young and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This kind of
      music expresses best what I think of the Germans: they belong to the day
      before yesterday and the day after tomorrow—THEY HAVE AS YET NO
      TODAY.
    </p>
<p>
      241. We "good Europeans," we also have hours when we allow ourselves a
      warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow
      views—I have just given an example of it—hours of national
      excitement, of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned
      floods of sentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what
      confines its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours—in
      a considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime,
      according to the speed and strength with which they digest and "change
      their material." Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races,
      which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century ere
      they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and
      soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to "good
      Europeanism." And while digressing on this possibility, I happen to become
      an ear-witness of a conversation between two old patriots—they were
      evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder. "HE
      has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as a peasant or a
      corps-student," said the one—"he is still innocent. But what does
      that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on their belly
      before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis. A statesman
      who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity of empire and
      power, they call 'great'—what does it matter that we more prudent
      and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief that it is
      only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or affair.
      Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being
      obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they were by
      nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have to sacrifice
      their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful
      mediocrity;—supposing a statesman were to condemn his people
      generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something
      better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they
      have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the
      restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially
      politics-practising nations;—supposing such a statesman were to
      stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to
      make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness, an
      offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate
      their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their
      minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'—what! a statesman who
      should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for
      throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman
      would be GREAT, would he?"—"Undoubtedly!" replied the other old
      patriot vehemently, "otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad
      perhaps to wish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just
      as mad at its commencement!"—"Misuse of words!" cried his
      interlocutor, contradictorily—"strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT
      great!"—The old men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted
      their "truths" in each other's faces, but I, in my happiness and
      apartness, considered how soon a stronger one may become master of the
      strong, and also that there is a compensation for the intellectual
      superficialising of a nation—namely, in the deepening of another.
    </p>
<p>
      242. Whether we call it "civilization," or "humanising," or "progress,"
      which now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without
      praise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in
      Europe—behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by
      such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever
      extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their increasing
      detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and hereditarily,
      united races originate, their increasing independence of every definite
      milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal demands
      on soul and body,—that is to say, the slow emergence of an
      essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who possesses,
      physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power of adaptation as
      his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING EUROPEAN, which can
      be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but will perhaps just gain and
      grow thereby in vehemence and depth—the still-raging storm and
      stress of "national sentiment" pertains to it, and also the anarchism
      which is appearing at present—this process will probably arrive at
      results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the apostles of
      "modern ideas," would least care to reckon. The same new conditions under
      which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take place—a
      useful, industrious, variously serviceable, and clever gregarious man—are
      in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most
      dangerous and attractive qualities. For, while the capacity for
      adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions, and begins a
      new work with every generation, almost with every decade, makes the
      POWERFULNESS of the type impossible; while the collective impression of
      such future Europeans will probably be that of numerous, talkative,
      weak-willed, and very handy workmen who REQUIRE a master, a commander, as
      they require their daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of
      Europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the
      most subtle sense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in
      individual and exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has
      perhaps ever been before—owing to the unprejudicedness of his
      schooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. I
      meant to say that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an
      involuntary arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTS—taking the word
      in all its meanings, even in its most spiritual sense.
    </p>
<p>
      243. I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the
      constellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth will do like
      the sun. And we foremost, we good Europeans!
    </p>
<p>
      244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans "deep" by way
      of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new Germanism is
      covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses "smartness" in all
      that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we
      did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation: in short,
      whether German depth is not at bottom something different and worse—and
      something from which, thank God, we are on the point of successfully
      ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn with regard to German
      depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of
      the German soul.—The German soul is above all manifold, varied in
      its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather than actually built: this
      is owing to its origin. A German who would embolden himself to assert:
      "Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast," would make a bad guess at the
      truth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the
      number of souls. As a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and
      mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-Aryan
      element as the "people of the centre" in every sense of the term, the
      Germans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown,
      more incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other
      peoples are to themselves:—they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby
      alone the despair of the French. It IS characteristic of the Germans that
      the question: "What is German?" never dies out among them. Kotzebue
      certainly knew his Germans well enough: "We are known," they cried
      jubilantly to him—but Sand also thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew
      what he was doing when he declared himself incensed at Fichte's lying but
      patriotic flatteries and exaggerations,—but it is probable that
      Goethe thought differently about Germans from Jean Paul, even though he
      acknowledged him to be right with regard to Fichte. It is a question what
      Goethe really thought about the Germans?—But about many things
      around him he never spoke explicitly, and all his life he knew how to keep
      an astute silence—probably he had good reason for it. It is certain
      that it was not the "Wars of Independence" that made him look up more
      joyfully, any more than it was the French Revolution,—the event on
      account of which he RECONSTRUCTED his "Faust," and indeed the whole
      problem of "man," was the appearance of Napoleon. There are words of
      Goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign
      land, that which Germans take a pride in, he once defined the famous
      German turn of mind as "Indulgence towards its own and others'
      weaknesses." Was he wrong? it is characteristic of Germans that one is
      seldom entirely wrong about them. The German soul has passages and
      galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-places, and dungeons therein, its
      disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious, the German is well
      acquainted with the bypaths to chaos. And as everything loves its symbol,
      so the German loves the clouds and all that is obscure, evolving,
      crepuscular, damp, and shrouded, it seems to him that everything
      uncertain, undeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is "deep". The German
      himself does not EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is "developing himself".
      "Development" is therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the
      great domain of philosophical formulas,—a ruling idea, which,
      together with German beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all
      Europe. Foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the
      conflicting nature at the basis of the German soul propounds to them
      (riddles which Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to
      music). "Good-natured and spiteful"—such a juxtaposition,
      preposterous in the case of every other people, is unfortunately only too
      often justified in Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians
      to know this! The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social
      distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and
      nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any
      one wishes to see the "German soul" demonstrated ad oculos, let him only
      look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish indifference
      to "taste"! How the noblest and the commonest stand there in
      juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of
      this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he
      experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets "done" with them;
      and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating "digestion." And
      just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what is convenient, so
      the German loves "frankness" and "honesty"; it is so CONVENIENT to be
      frank and honest!—This confidingness, this complaisance, this
      showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the most dangerous and
      most successful disguise which the German is up to nowadays: it is his
      proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can "still achieve much"! The
      German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty
      German eyes—and other countries immediately confound him with his
      dressing-gown!—I meant to say that, let "German depth" be what it
      will—among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at
      it—we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance
      and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a
      people of depth for Prussian "smartness," and Berlin wit and sand. It is
      wise for a people to pose, and LET itself be regarded, as profound,
      clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it might even be—profound
      to do so! Finally, we should do honour to our name—we are not called
      the "TIUSCHE VOLK" (deceptive people) for nothing....
    </p>
<p>
      245. The "good old" time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart—how
      happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his "good company,"
      his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the Chinese and its
      flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the
      amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the South, can still
      appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah, some time or other it will be over
      with it!—but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with
      the intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo of
      a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo of a
      great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven is the
      intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking
      down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING; there is spread
      over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope,—the
      same light in which Europe was bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when
      it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finally almost
      fell down in adoration before Napoleon. But how rapidly does THIS very
      sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of
      this sentiment, how strangely does the language of Rousseau, Schiller,
      Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of
      Europe was able to SPEAK, which knew how to SING in Beethoven!—Whatever
      German music came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a
      movement which, historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting,
      and more superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe
      from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weber—but
      what do WE care nowadays for "Freischutz" and "Oberon"! Or Marschner's
      "Hans Heiling" and "Vampyre"! Or even Wagner's "Tannhauser"! That is
      extinct, although not yet forgotten music. This whole music of
      Romanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to
      maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses;
      from the beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of
      by genuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that
      halcyon master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul,
      quickly acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the
      beautiful EPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who
      took things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first—he
      was the last that founded a school,—do we not now regard it as a
      satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism of
      Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the "Saxon
      Switzerland" of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like
      nature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)—his
      MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of
      injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY taste
      (that is to say, a dangerous propensity—doubly dangerous among
      Germans—for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going
      constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who
      revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning a
      sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE—this Schumann was already merely a
      GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had
      been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German
      music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE
      FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.
    </p>
<p>
      246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a
      THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of
      sounds without tune and rhythms without dance, which Germans call a
      "book"! And even the German who READS books! How lazily, how reluctantly,
      how badly he reads! How many Germans know, and consider it obligatory to
      know, that there is ART in every good sentence—art which must be
      divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a
      misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself is
      misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the rhythm-determining
      syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the too-rigid symmetry as
      intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and patient ear to
      every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should divine the sense in the
      sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how delicately and richly they
      can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangement—who
      among book-reading Germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties
      and requirements, and to listen to so much art and intention in language?
      After all, one just "has no ear for it"; and so the most marked contrasts
      of style are not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were
      SQUANDERED on the deaf.—These were my thoughts when I noticed how
      clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose-writing have
      been confounded: one, whose words drop down hesitatingly and coldly, as
      from the roof of a damp cave—he counts on their dull sound and echo;
      and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword, and from
      his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering,
      over-sharp blade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut.
    </p>
<p>
      247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the ear,
      is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write
      badly. The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the ear, but
      only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time.
      In antiquity when a man read—which was seldom enough—he read
      something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when any
      one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a loud voice:
      that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and variations of key
      and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC world took delight. The
      laws of the written style were then the same as those of the spoken style;
      and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and refined
      requirements of the ear and larynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and
      power of the ancient lungs. In the ancient sense, a period is above all a
      physiological whole, inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath. Such
      periods as occur in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling twice and sinking
      twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who
      knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein, the
      rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a period;—WE
      have really no right to the BIG period, we modern men, who are short of
      breath in every sense! Those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti
      in speaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently critics—they
      thus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same manner as in
      the last century, when all Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing,
      the virtuosoship of song (and with it also the art of melody) reached its
      elevation. In Germany, however (until quite recently when a kind of
      platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young
      wings), there was properly speaking only one kind of public and
      APPROXIMATELY artistical discourse—that delivered from the pulpit.
      The preacher was the only one in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable
      or a word, in what manner a sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and
      comes to a close; he alone had a conscience in his ears, often enough a
      bad conscience: for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory
      should be especially seldom attained by a German, or almost always too
      late. The masterpiece of German prose is therefore with good reason the
      masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best
      German book. Compared with Luther's Bible, almost everything else is
      merely "literature"—something which has not grown in Germany, and
      therefore has not taken and does not take root in German hearts, as the
      Bible has done.
    </p>
<p>
      248. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and
      seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified
      and brings forth. And similarly, among the gifted nations, there are those
      on whom the woman's problem of pregnancy has devolved, and the secret task
      of forming, maturing, and perfecting—the Greeks, for instance, were
      a nation of this kind, and so are the French; and others which have to
      fructify and become the cause of new modes of life—like the Jews,
      the Romans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the Germans?—nations
      tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and irresistibly forced out of
      themselves, amorous and longing for foreign races (for such as "let
      themselves be fructified"), and withal imperious, like everything
      conscious of being full of generative force, and consequently empowered
      "by the grace of God." These two kinds of geniuses seek each other like
      man and woman; but they also misunderstand each other—like man and
      woman.

      does not know—cannot know, the best that is in one.

<p>
      250. What Europe owes to the Jews?—Many things, good and bad, and
      above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the
      grand style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands,
      of infinite significations, the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral
      questionableness—and consequently just the most attractive,
      ensnaring, and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to
      life, in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its
      evening sky, now glows—perhaps glows out. For this, we artists among
      the spectators and philosophers, are—grateful to the Jews.
    </p>
<p>
      251. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and disturbances—in
      short, slight attacks of stupidity—pass over the spirit of a people
      that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national nervous fever and political
      ambition: for instance, among present-day Germans there is alternately the
      anti-French folly, the anti-Semitic folly, the anti-Polish folly, the
      Christian-romantic folly, the Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the
      Prussian folly (just look at those poor historians, the Sybels and
      Treitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads), and whatever else these
      little obscurations of the German spirit and conscience may be called. May
      it be forgiven me that I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very
      infected ground, did not remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like
      every one else, began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not
      concern me—the first symptom of political infection. About the Jews,
      for instance, listen to the following:—I have never yet met a German
      who was favourably inclined to the Jews; and however decided the
      repudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and
      political men, this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against
      the nature of the sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess,
      and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this
      excess of sentiment;—on this point we must not deceive ourselves.
      That Germany has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the
      German blood, has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing
      only of this quantity of "Jew"—as the Italian, the Frenchman, and
      the Englishman have done by means of a stronger digestion:—that is
      the unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct, to which
      one must listen and according to which one must act. "Let no more Jews
      come in! And shut the doors, especially towards the East (also towards
      Austria)!"—thus commands the instinct of a people whose nature is
      still feeble and uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily
      extinguished, by a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt
      the strongest, toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they
      know how to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than
      under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would
      like nowadays to label as vices—owing above all to a resolute faith
      which does not need to be ashamed before "modern ideas", they alter only,
      WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes its
      conquest—as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of
      yesterday—namely, according to the principle, "as slowly as
      possible"! A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all
      his perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he
      will calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest
      factors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present
      called a "nation" in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA
      (indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in
      every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet a
      race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such "nations"
      should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and hostility! It is
      certain that the Jews, if they desired—or if they were driven to it,
      as the anti-Semites seem to wish—COULD now have the ascendancy, nay,
      literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT working and
      planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they rather wish and
      desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe,
      they long to be finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and
      wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the "wandering Jew",—and
      one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency, and MAKE
      ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the Jewish instincts)
      for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the
      anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. One should make advances with all
      prudence, and with selection, pretty much as the English nobility do It
      stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new
      Germanism could enter into relation with the Jews with the least
      hesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian border it
      would be interesting in many ways to see whether the genius for money and
      patience (and especially some intellect and intellectuality—sadly
      lacking in the place referred to) could not in addition be annexed and
      trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeying—for both of
      which the country in question has now a classic reputation But here it is
      expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania
      for I have already reached my SERIOUS TOPIC, the "European problem," as I
      understand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for Europe.
    </p>
<p>
      252. They are not a philosophical race—the English: Bacon represents
      an ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke,
      an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a "philosopher" for more
      than a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself;
      it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, "JE MEPRISE LOCKE"; in the
      struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel
      and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the two hostile
      brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different directions towards
      the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby wronged each other as
      only brothers will do.—What is lacking in England, and has always
      been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd
      muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what
      he knew about himself: namely, what was LACKING in Carlyle—real
      POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual perception, in short,
      philosophy. It is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold
      on firmly to Christianity—they NEED its discipline for "moralizing"
      and humanizing. The Englishman, more gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and
      brutal than the German—is for that very reason, as the baser of the
      two, also the most pious: he has all the MORE NEED of Christianity. To
      finer nostrils, this English Christianity itself has still a
      characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for which,
      owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote—the finer poison to
      neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in
      advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards spiritualization. The
      English coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily
      disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or,
      more correctly, it is thereby explained and differently expressed); and
      for the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting
      under the influence of Methodism (and more recently as the "Salvation
      Army"), a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest
      manifestation of "humanity" to which they can be elevated: so much may
      reasonably be admitted. That, however, which offends even in the humanest
      Englishman is his lack of music, to speak figuratively (and also
      literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul
      and body; indeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for "music."
      Listen to him speaking; look at the most beautiful Englishwoman WALKING—in
      no country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans; finally,
      listen to them singing! But I ask too much...
    </p>
<p>
      253. There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds, because
      they are best adapted for them, there are truths which only possess charms
      and seductive power for mediocre spirits:—one is pushed to this
      probably unpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of respectable but
      mediocre Englishmen—I may mention Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and
      Herbert Spencer—begins to gain the ascendancy in the middle-class
      region of European taste. Indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful
      thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time? It would be an
      error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as
      specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common
      facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions, they are rather
      from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are "the
      rules." After all, they have more to do than merely to perceive:—in
      effect, they have to BE something new, they have to SIGNIFY something new,
      they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulf between knowledge and capacity
      is perhaps greater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks: the capable
      man in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant
      person;—while on the other hand, for scientific discoveries like
      those of Darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity, and industrious
      carefulness (in short, something English) may not be unfavourable for
      arriving at them.—Finally, let it not be forgotten that the English,
      with their profound mediocrity, brought about once before a general
      depression of European intelligence.
    </p>
<p>
      What is called "modern ideas," or "the ideas of the eighteenth century,"
      or "French ideas"—that, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind
      rose up with profound disgust—is of English origin, there is no
      doubt about it. The French were only the apes and actors of these ideas,
      their best soldiers, and likewise, alas! their first and profoundest
      VICTIMS; for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of "modern ideas," the AME
      FRANCAIS has in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at present one
      recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound, passionate
      strength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief. One must,
      however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in a determined
      manner, and defend it against present prejudices and appearances: the
      European NOBLESSE—of sentiment, taste, and manners, taking the word
      in every high sense—is the work and invention of FRANCE; the
      European ignobleness, the plebeianism of modern ideas—is ENGLAND'S
      work and invention.
    </p>
<p>
      254. Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual and
      refined culture of Europe, it is still the high school of taste; but one
      must know how to find this "France of taste." He who belongs to it keeps
      himself well concealed:—they may be a small number in whom it lives
      and is embodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon the
      strongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in part
      persons over-indulged, over-refined, such as have the AMBITION to conceal
      themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in presence
      of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic BOURGEOIS. In
      fact, a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawls in the
      foreground—it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste, and
      at the same time of self-admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo. There
      is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist
      intellectual Germanizing—and a still greater inability to do so! In
      this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism,
      Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than he
      has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has long ago
      been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists of Paris; or
      of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taine—the FIRST of living
      historians—exercises an almost tyrannical influence. As regards
      Richard Wagner, however, the more French music learns to adapt itself to
      the actual needs of the AME MODERNE, the more will it "Wagnerite"; one can
      safely predict that beforehand,—it is already taking place
      sufficiently! There are, however, three things which the French can still
      boast of with pride as their heritage and possession, and as indelible
      tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in Europe, in spite of
      all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and vulgarizing of taste.
      FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for devotion to "form," for
      which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along with numerous others, has
      been invented:—such capacity has not been lacking in France for
      three centuries; and owing to its reverence for the "small number," it has
      again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible, which
      is sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe.—The SECOND thing whereby
      the French can lay claim to a superiority over Europe is their ancient,
      many-sided, MORALISTIC culture, owing to which one finds on an average,
      even in the petty ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE
      PARIS, a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example,
      one has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany.
      The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite
      thereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call
      the Germans "naive" on that account give them commendation for a defect.
      (As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE
      PSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of
      German intercourse,—and as the most successful expression of genuine
      French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrills,
      Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning
      man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe, in fact, several
      centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and discoverer thereof:—it
      has required two generations to OVERTAKE him one way or other, to divine
      long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured him—this
      strange Epicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist of
      France).—There is yet a THIRD claim to superiority: in the French
      character there is a successful half-way synthesis of the North and South,
      which makes them comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other
      things, which an Englishman can never comprehend. Their temperament,
      turned alternately to and from the South, in which from time to time the
      Provencal and Ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the
      dreadful, northern grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and
      from poverty of blood—our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the
      excessive prevalence of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that
      is to say "high politics," has with great resolution been prescribed
      (according to a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but
      not yet hope).—There is also still in France a pre-understanding and
      ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too
      comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and know
      how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the South—the
      born Midlanders, the "good Europeans." For them BIZET has made music, this
      latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and seduction,—who has
      discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.
    </p>
<p>
      255. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music.
      Suppose a person loves the South as I love it—as a great school of
      recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a boundless
      solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign existence
      believing in itself—well, such a person will learn to be somewhat on
      his guard against German music, because, in injuring his taste anew, it
      will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner, a Southerner not by
      origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future of music, must also
      dream of it being freed from the influence of the North; and must have in
      his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and perhaps more perverse and
      mysterious music, a super-German music, which does not fade, pale, and die
      away, as all German music does, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and
      the Mediterranean clearness of sky—a super-European music, which
      holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose
      soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with big,
      beautiful, lonely beasts of prey... I could imagine a music of which the
      rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil; only
      that here and there perhaps some sailor's home-sickness, some golden
      shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it; an art which,
      from the far distance, would see the colours of a sinking and almost
      incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable
      enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives.
    </p>
<p>
      256. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has
      induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the
      short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this
      craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the
      disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude
      policy—owing to all this and much else that is altogether
      unmentionable at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES
      TO BE ONE, are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted.
      With all the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real
      general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare
      the way for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European
      of the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in
      old age perhaps, did they belong to the "fatherlands"—they only
      rested from themselves when they became "patriots." I think of such men as
      Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it
      must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about
      whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings
      (geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves), still
      less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and
      opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that Richard Wagner and
      the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are most closely and
      intimately related to one another. They are akin, fundamentally akin, in
      all the heights and depths of their requirements; it is Europe, the ONE
      Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards and upwards,
      in their multifarious and boisterous art—whither? into a new light?
      towards a new sun? But who would attempt to express accurately what all
      these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly? It is
      certain that the same storm and stress tormented them, that they SOUGHT in
      the same manner, these last great seekers! All of them steeped in
      literature to their eyes and ears—the first artists of universal
      literary culture—for the most part even themselves writers, poets,
      intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (Wagner, as
      musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians, as artist
      generally among actors); all of them fanatics for EXPRESSION "at any cost"—I
      specially mention Delacroix, the nearest related to Wagner; all of them
      great discoverers in the realm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and
      dreadful, still greater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of
      the show-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and out
      VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces, allures,
      constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the straight line,
      hankering after the strange, the exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and
      the self-contradictory; as men, Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus,
      who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life
      and action—think of Balzac, for instance,—unrestrained
      workers, almost destroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in
      manners, ambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all
      of them finally shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and
      with right and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently
      profound and sufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy?);—on
      the whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and
      aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their
      century—and it is the century of the MASSES—the conception
      "higher man."... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together
      as to whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or
      whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from
      SUPER-GERMAN sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be
      underrated how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type,
      which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most
      decisive time—and how the whole style of his proceedings, of his
      self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French
      socialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be
      found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has acted
      in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation than a
      nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done—owing to the
      circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the
      French;—perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner
      is not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and
      inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried,
      that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful,
      too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow civilized
      nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this anti-Latin
      Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days,
      when—anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politics—he
      began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least,
      THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.—That these last words may
      not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes, which
      will even betray to less delicate ears what I mean—what I mean
      COUNTER TO the "last Wagner" and his Parsifal music:—
    </p>
<p>
      —Is this our mode?—From German heart came this vexed
      ululating? From German body, this self-lacerating? Is ours this priestly
      hand-dilation, This incense-fuming exaltation? Is ours this faltering,
      falling, shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling? This sly
      nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly false enraptured
      heaven-o'erspringing?—Is this our mode?—Think well!—ye
      still wait for admission—For what ye hear is ROME—ROME'S FAITH
      BY INTUITION!
